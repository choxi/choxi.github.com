  title: Seemed Like a Bad Idea at the Time

In the spring of 2012, I decided to jump on the StartupBus. The [story behind the StartupBus is pretty interesting](http://startupbus.com/americas/about), but the gist of it is that every year on the drive down to SXSW, teams from different cities compete to launch a product during the 48 hour drive from their hometown to Austin, Texas.

If you want to read it, [here's the actual story of what we built on the bus](http://getshotput.tumblr.com/). Twilio also [wrote about us here](http://www.twilio.com/blog/2011/03/shotput-reaches-startup-bus-finals-at-sxsw.html). Basically, we built a service for organizations to build up SMS newsletters. You could create an SMS newsletter with an assigned hashtag, and when others texted the hashtag to a phone number they would be subscribed to that newsletter. The owner of that hashtag could then push messages to everyone that had subscribed.

At SXSW we created a #sxswparty newsletter and went around trying to get people subscribed to it. You'd just text "#sxswparty" to a phone number, and as the list owner I could push out SMS messages to everyone on the list and give them a heads up about all the parties going on at SXSW. Over the weekend at SXSW we got about ~300 people subscribed to the newsletter just by going around to parties and pitching in person.

So, having built a functioning product in 48 hours on a bus and coming up with a strategy to get 300 people at SXSW, we were able to win from the Chicago teams and get to the finals where we competed with teams from places like San Francisco, Miami, and New York in front of judges including Dave McClure and Naval Ravikant. 

We didn't do too well.

We got shot down for using SMS because "no one would be using it in 10 years when everyone has a free Android smartphone". We even got told by one of the judges (not Dave or Naval) that "no one gives a shit about \[our\] team". But despite that, it ended up being the beginning of the end for us -- we lost our mojo for this idea that had excited us at one point. 

**Sidenote:** Dave didn't agree that relying on SMS technology was necessarily a dead end, he's an investor in Twilio so he must believe there's something worthwhile there. 

Fast forward to last week when [Venturebeat announced that a company named SendHub raised $2 million dollars](http://venturebeat.com/2012/04/26/sendhub-seed-round/). I decided to check out [SendHub's demo video](http://youtu.be/elZ7X0OpSxs) -- it was like seeing Shotput come back from the grave.

To be honest, my initial reaction was of frustration and spite for the sometimes frivolous startup world. But it's too easy to be self-pitying and blame others. I have no hard feelings against SendHub, but I decided to sit down and figure out why we failed where SendHub has prospered:

- **Where they took 3 months of YC (or more) to gain traction and prove their own viability, we gave ourselves less than a week.** Dave, Naval, and the other judges make a career off of analyzing startups, and for us to take the work we did in 48 hours on a bus and pitch it to them was a setup for failure.
- **We gave up too early.** It's hard to go home after a sour defeat. So when some the smartest guys in our industry told us that what we're doing isn't going to work, it was hard to stay motivated. We did continue to give it a try anyway, but one by one our team dropped off until it was just me and [@h_bash](http://twitter.com/h_bash), and then both of us just stopped too.

Certainly it helped that they were in YCombinator and got more traction than we did, but I feel confident that we could have done that too if it weren't for the two reasons above that ultimately killed us. 

[@h_bash](http://twitter.com/h_bash), when he feels like channeling Jony Ive, likes to tell me that "ideas are fragile." At its core, the reason we failed is because we didn't give our idea enough time to grow into anything and we set ourselves up to fail by putting that frail idea up to intense scrutiny after only one week. Eventually, any idea will have to stand up on its own against the criticisms and mockery of the world at large, but at first, just let it grow.
