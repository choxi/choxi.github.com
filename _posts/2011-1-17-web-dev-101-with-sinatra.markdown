There have been a few posts about how too many developers never learn anything past the Rail's magic, and how this magic hinders education about web development. I tend to agree, hiding the details and letting people dive in and make blogs in 15 minutes is a great way to entice new devs and get them excited, but it's terrible for education purposes because you have no mental model to work off of.
