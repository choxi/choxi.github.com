I recently ran into a problem that I think every web developer runs into when they've decided to start a personal site or blog: should I write it myself or use a service? I took insight from two Sams who decided to weigh in on the problem:

Sam L: "real hackers roll their own"
Sam J: "Real hackers have better things to work on than building their blog =P"

This problem is specific to web developers. On one hand, it's almost a matter of pride to build your own blog using the tools of your trade. It's like if a candle-maker bought a candle from Bath and Body Works (bad analogies will be a common theme of my blog, but you get what I mean).

Pride aside, there are some really excellent blogging tools available in these crazy post-2.0 days. Topping the list amongst my own friends is Posterous. It's stupid simple, very convenient, and looks great out of the box so that the average user will not have to inflict his or her terrible design tastes on the rest of the world (lest we forget MySpace). I approve.

What it boils down to is pride and flexibility versus convenience and efficiency. If you want a new feature for your blog, you can write it. It's your craft and your brand, even if it shaves off some of your free time now and then. With Posterous, your trading all of that for the ability to start right away, write your posts, and never have to worry about blog maintenance in the foreseeable future. 

If you've gotten this far, you've probably noticed that I opted out of Posterous. I just like building things, and when it came down to starting my own blog I decided to roll my own.
