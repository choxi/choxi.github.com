  title: Did You Guys Hear We Got Osama?

I think I got my first computer all for myself in 2004 when I went to a boarding school in Illinois. The thing that really blew my mind was the unlimited amount of information that I just wished I could absorb into my brain. "I'm going to know everything there is to know," I told myself as I subscribed to The New York Times, The Economost, Wall Street Journal, Wired, and at least a dozen other blogs on Google Reader. Politics, economics, science, whatever your choice of topic was I would never be caught uninformed. It's only in hindsight that I see what felt like self improvement at the time was actually the beginning of a terrible addiction.

It got overwhelming really fast. I added filters, I tried a dozen different RSS readers, I even learned how to speed read over the course of a few years just to keep pace with my reader. This was serious business, how would I keep up to date with the Human Genome Project and Bush's latest folly if I start slacking on my Reader queue? Over time, I'd get better at reading quickly to the point where I was just skimming headlines and technology would improve so I could consume news within a 140 character limit or save the important items to read later (feeds within feeds, all the way down).

The first column supporting my addiction crumbled around the time I started college. Obama was running for president, the murmurings of the debt crisis had begun, and despite the 20-30 articles I consumed every day and the catch phrases I learned to repeat in front of my friends to sound knowledgable, I still had no idea what was actually going on. I was standing around with everyone in the world trying to shout louder than everyone else, trying to find the nuggets of truth in what can only be described as the clusterfuck of American media, when I said to myself, "well, fuck this shit." and turned my back on it all. I didn't vote that year. I got less and less vocal about my political opinions. And, most importantly, I phased out the majority of my RSS reader. Goodbye to Wired, The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, The Economist, and Google News. I was ready to see what would happen if I turned it all off and embraced not knowing anything about current events.

What followed was the most productive three years of my life.

That's when I learned an important truth about news. Whether it's TechCrunch, The New York Times, Wired, or Fox News: their job isn't to educate or inform you, it's literally to entertain you. You're not reading it all because you think you'll be more knowledgable or more informed, you're reading it because you want to be distracted, because consuming has a more immediate reward than creating.

Did you guys hear about the Path scandal? Did you know Kickstarter is completely changing the fundraising landscape? "That's just gossip, I don't read the gossip," you might say. Well the same goes for the 30 articles that come up each day about how to run your startup better. It doesn't even matter if each of those posts had a fantastic message, do you really think your reading the article can replace the deliberate effort it takes to run a better startup?

Now I'll really go off on a limb to make a point, and if I'm pushing you too far in this paragraph please don't disregard the whole post. Say that you somehow didn't know we found and killed Osama Bin Laden last year, I propose that your life would be virtually the same than if you did. What if you didn't even know who the current president was? Besides for the obvious social embarassment, would your day-to-day be any different? If you read three articles every day about the presidential candidates, come time to cast your ballot could you convince yourself that you're making an informed vote and not just one based on questionable factoids and the dogma of your closest social circle?

Hyperbole aside, I realize there's some irony in the medium of this message being a blog post. I'm not advocating that you pack up canned beans and a Snuggie and go off the grid, just turn down the noise in your life. I've gotten my sources of consumption (I don't even call it "news" anymore) down to just HackerNews, and I probably check it twice a day on average and only read one or two posts. Hopefully you're not impressed, but for me chopping things down from 50 tweets, 10 blog posts, 15 news articles, and a couple dozen Facebook posts a day to just two HackerNews posts took a long time.

Give it a try. You'll be surprised how much of the world you can tune out with no negative side effects.
