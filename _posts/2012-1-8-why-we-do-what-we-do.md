### "If you're doing this to get rich, then please just stop and go do something else. Law school, medical school, Wall Street, selling ebooks, whatever."

That was a response from a HackerNews user to [a post by a frustrated entrepreneur](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3439277). I don't mean to pick on that particular response, it's just an example of a general sentiment in the Valley that entrepreneurs should not be motivated by wealth.

I get where the sentiment is coming from. No one wants to see Silicon
Valley turn into that kind of [Boiler Room](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0181984/), flip-companies, get-rich-quick kind of place. But it's also completely disingenuous to say that your only motivation should be to make the world a better place. The reality of it is that we're all driven by a lot of things, some of them are more altruistic than others. Here are some of my motivations for founding a startup (in no particular order):

*   Be famous (or semi-famous)
*   Be able to buy the top-tier things
*   Make a dent in the universe
*   Make enough money for me and my family to never have to worry about
    it again
*   To make wealth (Paul Graham has an essay on this: [How to Make Wealth](http://www.paulgraham.com/wealth.html))
*   Impress girls
*   Be [kind of a big deal](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYdYDL5L3LU)
*   Meet other "big deal" people
*   Make my friends and family proud
*   To spite all the haters in high school/college
*   To learn
*   To prove to myself that I can do it

That's my honest list. They're obviously not all weighted the same way,
but I'd be lying if I said they weren't all factors.

The great thing about the Valley is that, unlike Wall Street, the system's built so that you
mostly can't make money without also creating value.
