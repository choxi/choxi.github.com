A while back, Radiolab did a podcast on [Loops](http://www.radiolab.org/2011/oct/04/) where they talked about the cycle of a whale's existence and what happens after it dies. At the time, no one really knew what happened to the body of a whale after it died and sank to the ocean floor, but what they found out was, oddly enough, inspiring.


It turns out that an entire new ecosystem of life flourished on the whale's death. There were eels, stone crabs, shrimp, sea scuds, sharks, crustaceans, and more just thriving off of the new environment created by the tanked carcass. Sort of serendipitously, the span of the ecosystem that lived in the carcass of the whale lasted about as long as the lifetime of the whale itself.

When we look around at today's media ecosystem, there are a few whales I'd like to see finally settle to the depths of their graves. These are the record labels, television networks, and other media conglomerates that have choked off innovation for so long. It's completely ridiculous that I still have to subscribe to a package of 100+ channels of mind-rotting crap just to watch a couple TV shows. Even worse, I have to watch it during an arbitrary time window instead of on my own schedule. And I still can't watch most of it on my computer?

Here's to you, Netflix, Spotify, Pandora and company. The future of media can't come soon enough.
